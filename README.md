#Just Like Fire
###A game by Alexander Hennie-Roed

##Description:
You are trapped on a plane of existance where there are little balls of fire that float around. Just don't touch them, and you'll be fine.

##Gameplay:
You must avoid the fire balls for as long as possible. Your time alive is displayed at the top of the screen along with the current difficulty level. You start with five fire balls on the screen. Every thirty seconds the difficulty level will increase, as will the number of fire balls. Try to stay alive in the chaos that is sure to ensue.
